## Known Issues

### v1.0.0

#### Fleet Software Manager - Partial Implementation
- **Missing Functions:**
  - `viewSoftware(id)` - Cannot view individual software details in modal
  - `deleteSoftware(id)` - Cannot delete software packages
- **Working Features:**
  - CREATE software (fully functional)
  - LIST software (fully functional)
  - UPDATE software (fully functional via form)
  - Versions management (READ operations functional)
  - Installations tracking (READ operations functional)
  - Dashboard statistics (fully functional)
- **Impact:** Medium - Core CRUD operations work, but detail view and delete are missing
- **Workaround:** Use API directly at `/docs` for delete operations
- **Planned Fix:** Q4 2025 (see TODO.md)

#### UI/UX Minor Issues
- Legacy auth sections still present in HTML (hidden via CSS, no functionality impact)
- Browser console warnings about password fields not in forms (cosmetic, harmless)
- Sidebar navigation errors in some modules (non-blocking)

#### Documentation
- Database schema documentation (docs/DATABASE.md) has been corrected to match actual implementation
- All 14 tables documented with correct field names and relationships
